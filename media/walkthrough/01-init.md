**What this does**
- Creates a Python venv (default: `locust_env`)
- Installs Locust, har2locust, MCP and all other dependencies
- Installs Locust, har2locust, MCP and all other dependencies
- Sets VS Codeâ€™s interpreter to the venv
- Writes `.vscode/mcp.json` so Copilot MCP tools work
- If you already have Locust globally, this still sets up a local, isolated environment.
