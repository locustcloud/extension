## Locust Tests Tree

- If you add/remove users or tasks the Locust Tests Tree is automatically updated. 
- If not click **Refresh Tests** to re-scan your locustfiles in `templates` directory.  
- The Locust Scenarios tree groups classes and `@task` methods.
- This applies only when code in a Locust Test file is changed or new file is created.
